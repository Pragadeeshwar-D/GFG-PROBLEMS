Rearrange the array
Difficulty: BasicAccuracy: 48.03%Submissions: 14K+Points: 1
Given an array arr[] containing integers,  your task is to print the array in the order â€“ smallest number, largest number, 2nd smallest number, 2nd largest number, 3rd smallest number, 3rd largest number and so on.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 9, 2, 8, 3, 7, 4, 6, 5]
Output: [1, 9, 2, 8, 3, 7, 4, 6, 5]
Explanation: Smallest number is 1. Largest number is 9. 2nd smallest number is 2. Then 2nd largest number is 8. And so on.
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: [1, 4, 2, 3]
Expected Time Complexity: O(n*logn)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)

Constraints: 
1 <= arr.size()<= 105
1 <= arr[i] <=106

 




SOLUTION :



class Solution {
  public:
    void rearrangeArray(vector<int>& arr) {
        // code here
        int n = arr.size();
        int arr1[n];
        sort(arr.begin(),arr.end());
        int c = n-1;
        int d = 0;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
            if(i%2==0)
            {
                arr1[i] = arr[d];
                d++;
            }
            else
            {
                arr1[i] = arr[c];
                c--;
            }
        }
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
            arr[i] = arr1[i];
        }
    }
};
